## Problem Description
This front-end UI style guide is a collection of modular components 
in the OpenBMC user interface. It includes rules and descriptions 
for color, typography, margins/spacing, interactions, etc, to help 
designers / developers across all companies contributing to the 
OpenBMC GUI achieve visual and behavior consistency when designing 
and coding GUI panels. It benefits the UX team in two ways: 
(1) prototyping ideas and implementing new designs becomes more 
efficient, and (2) a consistent visual design can be easily enforced 
throughout the product.
